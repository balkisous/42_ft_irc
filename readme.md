# Ft_Irc 📚
Created an Irc server.

## Description 🔍

The objective of this project is to reproduce the operation of an IRC (Internet Relay Chat) server, so that several IRC clients can connect; carried out in a group.
     This project allowed me to code for the first time a large project in OOP, it was very interesting to look at the question of which object to create or which functions or attributes. The analysis was stimulating 😊.
